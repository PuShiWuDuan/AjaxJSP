	<TestDescription>
		<Item text="Verify that a host can choose proper router from its Default Router List."/>
		<Item text=""/>
		<Item detail="yes" text="The policy for selecting routers from the Default Router List is as follows: Routers that are reachable or probably reachable (i.e., in any state other than INCOMPLETE) SHOULD be preferred over routers whose reachability is unknown or suspect (i.e., in the INCOMPLETE state, or for which no Neighbor Cache entry exists). An implementation may choose to always return the same router or cycle through the router list in a round-robin fashion as long as it always returns a reachable or a probably reachable router when one is available. When no routers on the list are known to be reachable or probably reachable, routers SHOULD be selected in a round-robin fashion, so that subsequent requests for a default router do not return the same router until all other routers have been selected. Cycling through the router list in this case ensures that all available routers are actively probed by Neighbor Unreachability Detection algorithm. A request for a default router is made in conjunction with the sending of a packet to a router, and the selected router will be probed for reachability as a side effect. If the Default Router List is empty, assume that all destinations are on-link as specified in Section 5.2."/>
